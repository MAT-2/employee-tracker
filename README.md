# Description

A backend project creating an employee tracker system within the terminal. It was fun being creative with using ASCII Art for the logo, and being able to create databases based on Inquirer prompt options and using switch cases to make choosing between options intuitive. The only difficulty was using SQL syntax to format the tables to connect between each other.
